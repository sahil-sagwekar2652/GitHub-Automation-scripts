## Asking Questions

If you want to ask a question, join the 'contributing' slack channel of the Project. Click [here](https://join.slack.com/t/githubautomat-9t49360/shared_invite/zt-1v05p5kao-UBmelVfZd6EBjGuzd_6XYg) to join the workspace on Slack.

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/sahil-sagwekar2652/GitHub-Automation-scripts.git/issues) that might help you. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide details about the your OS and environment.


## How To Contribute

- Fork the project on GitHub, clone it on your PC.
- If you have an idea for an enhancement or a bug you can first check the [Issues](https://github.com/sahil-sagwekar2652/GitHub-Automation-scripts.git/issues) to see if your question has been asked before.
- If you'd like to work on an issue, please ask the creator of the issue to assign it to you. This helps to keep the workflow streamlined.
- **Make sure to push your code to the ```contributing``` branch.**
- Make sure to make the appropriate changes in the README.md file if you are adding a new script or feature.


## Styleguides

This project uses the Flake8 linter to lint the Python code. If you are using VSCode, I would suggest installing the [Flake8 linter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.flake8) for VSCode.
