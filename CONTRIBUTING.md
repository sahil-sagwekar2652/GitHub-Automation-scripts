## Asking Questions

If you want to ask a question, join the 'GitHub Automation scripts' project channel on the GSSoC discord server. To join the project channel, make sure you have the 'GitHub Automation scripts' & 'Contributor' role assigned to you. If you don't have the role assigned to you, you can self-assign it in the [#self-roles](https://discord.com/channels/1099745007172329592/1099745007675646046) channel.

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/sahil-sagwekar2652/GitHub-Automation-scripts.git/issues) that might help you. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide details about the your OS and environment.


## How To Contribute

- Fork the project on GitHub, clone it on your PC.
- If you have an idea for an enhancement or a bug you can first check the [Issues](https://github.com/sahil-sagwekar2652/GitHub-Automation-scripts.git/issues) to see if your question has been asked before.
- If you'd like to work on an issue, please ask the creator of the issue to assign it to you. This helps to keep the workflow streamlined.
- Create a new branch for your contribution and make the changes you want to make. (Always check for updates on the main branch before creating a pull request to avoid merge conflicts.)
- The pull request should mention the issue it is trying to solve and should be linked to it. Here is a video on how to link PRs to issues - [video link](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword).
- Make sure to make the appropriate changes in the README.md file if you are adding a new script or feature.


## Styleguides

This project uses the Flake8 linter to lint the Python code. If you are using VSCode, I would suggest installing the [Flake8 linter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.flake8) for VSCode.
