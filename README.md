# GitHub Automation Scripts ü§ñ
![](https://github.com/sahil-sagwekar2652/GitHub-Automation-scripts/workflows/Flake8Linter/badge.svg)

This repository hosts scripts written in bash script and python to automate common Git/GitHub workflows. Normally to connect a local repository to GitHub one has to go to the GitHub website, create a new respository and then add the new GitHub repo as a remote for your local repository. The [create_repo](scripts/create_repo) script automates this process.

## Tech üñ•Ô∏è
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,bash,git,github&perline=4)](https://skillicons.dev)

## Installation
##### Requirements:
- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your computer.
- **GitHub personal access token**. (Go to your GitHub profile -> Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal Access Tokens -> Create new token with all the repository permissions)


#### ```Note!!! This script is written exclusively for Git Bash on Windows, you will have to modify it for other shells.```

- ### Step 1:
Fork and clone the repository locally.

- ### Step 2:
Create a ```github_secrets.py``` file in the ./scripts folder and define the following variables inside it.

```py
GITHUB_API_TOKEN = "Your GitHub personal access token"
USERNAME = "Your GitHub username"
```

- ### Step 3:

#### Add the project path to the PATH variable (Recommended)

Run the following command in the project's base directory to add the scripts path to the PATH environment variable.

```sh
$ export PATH=$PATH":"$(pwd)"/scripts"
```

To permanently add the scripts path to the PATH variable, run the below command in the project's root directory. (This file is located in your home directory)  

**Make sure to backup the .bash_profile file elsewhere before making any changes to it.**

```sh
$ echo 'export PATH=$PATH''":'"$(pwd)"'/scripts''"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

<p style="text-align:center;font-size:1.75rem">OR</p>

#### Run the following commands in the project folder to add the scripts to your bin directory
```sh
$ cp -r /scripts/* /usr/bin/
```
## Python download
To download Python 
<a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.3/python-3.11.3-amd64.exe"></a>

## The modules:
Mainly there are some specific modules which are highly essential for this automation-script:
Those are:
- ### argparse
- ### os
- ### http
- ### client
- ### json
- ### github_secrets
## Downloading the module
#### Run the following commands in shell to download the modules
```sh
$ pip install argparse
```
```sh
$ pip install os
```
```sh
$ pip install http
```
```sh
$ pip install client
```
```sh
$ pip install json
```
```sh
$ pip install github_secrets
```
If the shell showing to update pip use the command
```sh
$ pip install --upgrade pip
```
## How to use
After the installation is complete then the 'create_repo' command should execute in any directory.

- Run the command with a '-h' flag to see the help menu
```sh
create_repo -h
```
- Sample usage
```sh
create_repo <PATH_NAME> <REPO_NAME>
```
- <PATH_NAME> is the path where you want to create the local repository and <REPO_NAME> is the name for your repo
- Example:
```sh
create_repo . test-repo
```
The result is a local respository is created with a connected remote repository automatically!
